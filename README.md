The [Metropolitan Museum of Art](http://www.metmuseum.org) presents over 5,000 years of art from around the world for everyone to experience and enjoy. The Museum lives in three iconic sites in New York City—The Met Fifth Avenue, The Met Breuer, and The Met Cloisters. Millions of people also take part in The Met experience online.

Since it was founded in 1870, The Met has always aspired to be more than a treasury of rare and beautiful objects. Every day, art comes alive in the Museum's galleries and through its exhibitions and events, revealing both new ideas and unexpected connections across time and across cultures.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art provides select datasets of information on more than 420,000 artworks in its Collection for unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use. To the extent possible under law, The Metropolitan Museum of Art has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this dataset using [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This work is published from: The United States Of America. You can also find the text of the CC Zero deed in the file [LICENSE](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess/blob/master/LICENSE) in this repository. These select datasets are now available for use in any media without permission or fee; they also include identifying data for artworks under copyright. The datasets support the search, use, and interaction with the Museum’s collection. 

At this time, the datasets are available in CSV format, encoded in UTF-8. While UTF-8 is the standard for multilingual character encodings, it is not correctly interpreted by Excel on a Mac. Users of Excel on a Mac can convert the UTF-8 to UTF-16 so the file can be imported correctly.

## Additional usage guidelines

Images are not included and are not part of the dataset. Companion artworks listed in the dataset covered by the policy are identified in the [Collection section](http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection) of the Museum’s website  with the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) icon.

### Documentation in progress
This data is provided “as is” and you use this data at your own risk. The Metropolitan Museum of Art makes no representations or warranties of any kind. Documentation of the Museum’s collection is an ongoing process and parts of the datasets are incomplete. 

We plan to update the datasets with new and revised information on a regular basis. You are advised to regularly update your copy of the datasets to ensure you are using the best available information.
